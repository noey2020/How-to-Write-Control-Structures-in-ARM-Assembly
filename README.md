Controlling Program Execution Flows

4 Ways to Alter Program Execution

  1. Branch, Unconditional
  2. Branch, Conditional
  3. Call Subroutine
  4. Interrupts

Branch instructions are used to alter the direction of program execution from the normal flow of control. These branch deviations can either be: unconditional or conditional. Unconditionals jump whereas conditionals test for conditions before branching out.

We “branch” according to a decision made which is a comparison operation.
